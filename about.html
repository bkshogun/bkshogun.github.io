	<p>Founded in 2012 by Michael de Gaetano, the name Shogun Travel came after he was moved by one particular character in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Crt4S1IZM">The Last Dragon</a> and thought that Sho'nuff, the Shogun of Harlem, was pretty badass. <br> <img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.retroist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/shonuff.jpg?fit=350%2C370" alt="Sho'nuff"> <br> It has nothing to do with the agency, Mr. de Gaetano just loves to travel, jump out of stuff, jump into stuff, and climb other stuff... and maybe fancies himself a shogun.</p>
